        <p>Just look at this fuckin' beautiful house. Gorgeous. I bet I could fit three fucking families into this house. Shit, think of the savings. That's like, a lot of money or something. It's gotta be, sharing the bills across three whole families? Look at that badass balcony and tell me you don't want this house. I'm waiting.</p>

        <p>This wonderful home has been built from the highest quality bricks available from around the world. They were
            probably made through forced labor, which really sucks. That's really sad, actually. Now I really don't even want to talk about this
            house. In fact, I want it gone. I wonder how much time I'd get for arson...</p>

        <p>An old witch used to live here. She could still be living here, I don't know. She was pretty evil. I heard she once kidnapped a kid and fed him all kinds of junk, like candy, soda, even conjured toys up for him. You don't think that sounds so bad? Yeah well, she sent him back to the parents and he's a fuckin' nightmare now.</p>
